Automatic Maze Solver
Language: C#
Summary:
Programmed a automatic maze solver using C# using recursion to check all 
the available paths. If a user uploads a bmp file with a maze, the program scales the
 image and checks pixel by pixel for the correct path for all the directions: up, down,
 left and right. The user can see the correct path of the maze and along with the dead 
path it took to reach the end of the maze. 
â€¢	Implemented a recursive algorithm in C# checking all the possible ways to increase the efficiency of maze solver
